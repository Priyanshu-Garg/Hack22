CONTRIBUTING TO OPEN SOURCE ISN’T JUST FOR TECHNICAL FOLKS WHO WANT TO WRITE CODE. THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO USE YOUR PROFESSIONAL SKILLS IN SUPPORT OF OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS. THIS YEAR, WE’RE MAKING A POINT TO ENCOURAGE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT REQUIRE SOME TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE OR NONE AT ALL. NO MATTER YOUR EXPERIENCE, YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN HACKTOBERFEST!

HACKTOBERFEST WELCOMES PEOPLE OF ANY EXPERIENCE LEVEL TO PARTICIPATE, AND LOW-CODE AND NON-CODE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FANTASTIC CHOICES FOR FOLKS WHO DON’T HAVE A LOT OF TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE. HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF WAYS YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS:

LOW-CODE	NON-CODE
WRITING	
TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
TRANSLATING
COPY EDITING
DESIGN	
TESTING
USER EXPERIENCE TESTING
GRAPHIC DESIGN
VIDEO PRODUCTION
ADVOCACY**	
TALKS OR PRESENTATIONS
TECHNICAL BLOG POSTS
PODCASTS
CASE STUDIES
SOCIAL MEDIA
BLOG POSTS
CONTRIBUTORS SUBMITTING LOW- OR NON-CODE CONTENT TO PROJECTS SHOULD CREATE A PR/MR TO TRACK IT. WHILE HACKTOBERFEST TRACKS ALL PR/MRS SUBMITTED FOR THE EVENT, MAINTAINERS MAY NEED TO FACILITATE TRACKING OF THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH AN ACTIVITY LOG OR SIMILAR.
